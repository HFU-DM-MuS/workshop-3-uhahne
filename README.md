# Mathematik und Simulation - Seminar Workshop 3

This repository contains buggy code. The task during the workshop is to fix the bugs, so that the program does what is stated in the [MultipleCirclesBouncing Java class description](./src/app/MultipleCirclesBouncing.java) in line 14ff:

 The class shall do the following:
 - Create a window (JFrame) with a grey panel.
 - 10 red balls are placed randomly on the panel.
 - Each ball has a velocity and moves around individually.
 - The balls bounce from the walls of the panel.
 - The bouncing happens at the window border even when the window size is changed.

 TODO: Fix the bugs so that the class does what stated above.
